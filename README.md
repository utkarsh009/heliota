## Introduction
**Disclaimer**: I am not responsible for any lost funds or Damage caused. Use at
your own risk.<br>
This is a GUI for [Iota Command-line Wallet](https://github.com/MichaelSchwab/iota-commandline-wallet)
that works on Linux.

## Prerequisites
1. Set up your wallet as instructed in [Iota Command-line Wallet](https://github.com/MichaelSchwab/iota-commandline-wallet), but, use all the files from this repository only, because I've started making some changes in `my-wallet.js` too.
2. Additionally, make sure that `zenity` is installed. (It is generally installed
  by default)

## Installation
As of now, there's nothing special. Just execute `heliota.sh`.

## TODO
This is just the first commit. You are encouraged to test it at your own risk.
There are lots of features to be added. I will put up an updated list here soon.
